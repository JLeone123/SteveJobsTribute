# A Tribute Page to Steve Jobs
I completed this project in order to get the Responsive Web Design Certification on freeCodeCamp.

If you'd like to see my own version of this project, which includes JavaScript using the Express Node.js framework and some jQuery, the link to that project is <a title="link to my version of the project!" href="#">here!</a>

If you'd like to run the project yourself, you can clone the repository using Git or download the zip file of the project.  You can run the project by running it with Node.js, opening the file index.html with your preferred browser, or create a Docker Image to run the project using the Nginx web server.

### Using Docker
```Dockerfile
docker build -t <image-name>:<tag-name> .
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 <image-name>:<tag-name>
curl localhost:5000 # to make sure the server's running!
```
